# Teacher Dashboard Design & Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for the Teacher-focused Dashboard in the ThinkEnglish application. The dashboard serves as the central hub for teachers to manage their daily classes, lessons, attendance, and homework.

## Design Concept: Simplified Teacher & Class Selection Dashboard

### Core Vision
A clean, teacher-centric dashboard that serves as their daily command center for managing classes, students, and lessons with intelligent lesson context detection based on current time and schedule.

## 1. Dashboard Entry Flow

### Teacher/Class Selection Interface
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Welcome to ThinkEnglish                                 │
│ Select Teacher & Class                                  │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────   │
│ Teacher: [Dropdown: John Smith ▼]                      │
│ Class:   [Dropdown: English B2 Advanced ▼]             │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────   │
│ [View Dashboard]                                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Selection Logic:**
- Teacher dropdown shows all active teachers
- Once teacher is selected, Class dropdown populates with their assigned classes
- System remembers last selection for quick access
- **One teacher can only be active in one class at a time**

---

## 2. Intelligent Lesson Preselection

### Time-Based Logic
1. **Current Time Matches Lesson**: Auto-select the ongoing lesson
2. **Between Lessons**: Auto-select next scheduled lesson for today
3. **No More Lessons Today**: Show "No more lessons scheduled today"
4. **No Lessons This Day**: Show appropriate message with next available lesson

### Smart Selection Display
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
