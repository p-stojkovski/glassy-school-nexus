# Homework Completion Tracking in Attendance Management

## Overview
Enhance the attendance marking process by adding homework completion tracking for each student. This feature will allow teachers to mark whether students have completed their homework assignments during the same session as attendance marking, providing a consolidated view of student engagement and academic responsibility. The homework completion status will be stored alongside attendance records and be available for reporting and student profile views.

## User Story
As a teacher, I want to mark homework completion status for each student while taking attendance so that I can efficiently track student academic responsibility and engagement in one streamlined process, and have this information available for parent communication and academic evaluation.

## User Journey
1. Teacher navigates to Attendance Management page
2. Selects a specific class and date for attendance marking
3. Views the attendance marking interface with student list
4. For each student, marks attendance status (Present/Absent/Late)
5. **NEW**: After marking attendance status, sees homework completion checkbox
6. Checks or unchecks homework completion for each present student
7. Optionally adds notes about homework (incomplete, late, excellent, etc.)
8. Submits the combined attendance and homework record
9. Can later review homework completion rates in attendance history
10. Information is available in student profiles for parent meetings and progress reviews

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Display Homework Completion Checkbox
- Given I am marking attendance for a class
- When I view the attendance marking table
- Then I should see a "Homework Completed" checkbox for each student
- And the checkbox should appear after the attendance status selection
- And the checkbox should be clearly labeled and styled consistently with the app

### Scenario 2: Homework Completion for Present Students
- Given a student is marked as "Present"
- When I view their homework completion options
- Then the homework completion checkbox should be enabled and interactive
- And I should be able to check/uncheck the homework completion status
- And the checkbox should default to unchecked (homework not completed)

### Scenario 3: Homework Completion for Absent Students
- Given a student is marked as "Absent"
- When I view their homework completion options
- Then the homework completion checkbox should be disabled
- And it should show a visual indication that homework completion is not applicable
- And the status should default to "N/A" for absent students

### Scenario 4: Homework Completion for Late Students
- Given a student is marked as "Late" 
- When I view their homework completion options
- Then the homework completion checkbox should be enabled and interactive
- And I should be able to mark homework completion status
- And the functionality should work the same as for present students

### Scenario 5: Homework Notes and Comments
- Given I am marking homework completion status
- When I want to add specific notes about a student's homework
- Then I should be able to add notes in the existing notes field
- And homework-related notes should be distinguishable from attendance notes
- And notes should support common homework scenarios (late, partial, excellent, etc.)

### Scenario 6: Data Persistence and Editing
- Given I have previously submitted attendance with homework completion data
- When I edit an existing attendance record
- Then the homework completion status should be preserved and editable
- And I should be able to update homework completion independently of attendance status
- And all changes should be saved to localStorage

### Scenario 7: Validation and Submission
- Given I am submitting attendance with homework tracking
- When I click submit
- Then the system should validate that all present students have homework status marked
- And if homework completion is unmarked for present students, show a warning but allow submission
- And the submission should include both attendance and homework data

### Scenario 8: Display in Attendance History
- Given I have submitted attendance records with homework completion
- When I view attendance history
- Then I should see homework completion statistics in the history view
- And I should be able to filter or sort by homework completion rates
- And individual student homework status should be visible in detailed views
