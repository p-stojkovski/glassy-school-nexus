# Student Form Page Conversion

## Overview
Convert the current student add/edit sidebar functionality to a dedicated page-based approach to improve user experience and accommodate the growing complexity of the student form. The sidebar has become too constrained for the extensive form fields including student information, parent/guardian details, and financial information sections.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Current Approach**: Uses shadcn/ui Sheet component as a right-side sidebar
- **Form Component**: `StudentForm.tsx` - Complex form with 3 collapsible sections (500+ lines)
- **State Management**: 
  - `useStudentForm` hook manages form state, CRUD operations, and sidebar visibility
  - `useStudentManagement` hook handles data filtering and navigation
- **Form Sections**:
  1. **Student Information** (required fields: name, status, dateOfBirth)
  2. **Parent/Guardian Information** (optional contact details)
  3. **Financial Information** (discount types and amounts)

### Current User Flow
1. User clicks "Add Student" or "Edit" action from StudentManagement page
2. `Sheet` component opens from right side with form
3. Form renders with collapsible sections using `FormSection` component
4. User fills form and submits
5. Form closes and returns to StudentManagement page

### Technical Components Involved
- **Pages**: `/src/pages/StudentManagement.tsx` - Main list view with Sheet integration
- **Form**: `/src/domains/students/components/forms/StudentForm.tsx` - Main form component
- **Hooks**: 
  - `/src/domains/students/hooks/useStudentForm.ts` - Form state management
  - `/src/domains/students/hooks/useStudentManagement.ts` - List management
- **UI Components**: Sheet, FormSection, various shadcn/ui form components

## User Story

As a school administrator, I want to add and edit student information on a dedicated page rather than in a constrained sidebar, so that I can have more screen real estate to work with complex student forms and provide better user experience when managing detailed student information.

## User Journey

### Current Journey (Sidebar)
1. Navigate to Student Management page
2. Click "Add Student" or "Edit" button
3. Sheet slides in from right covering portion of the screen
4. Scroll through constrained form in sidebar
5. Submit form and return to main page

### New Journey (Dedicated Page)
1. Navigate to Student Management page
2. Click "Add Student" or "Edit" button
3. Navigate to dedicated form page (`/students/new` or `/students/edit/:id`)
4. Work with full-screen form with better layout
5. Submit form and navigate back to Student Management page
6. Alternatively, use breadcrumb navigation to return without saving

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Add New Student via Dedicated Page
- Given I am on the Student Management page
- When I click the "Add Student" button
- Then I should navigate to `/students/new` route
- And I should see a full-page form with the same fields as the current sidebar form
- And I should see proper page navigation (breadcrumbs or back button)
- And the form should have the same validation rules and behavior

### Scenario 2: Edit Existing Student via Dedicated Page
- Given I am viewing a student in the Student Management table
- When I click the "Edit" action for a student
- Then I should navigate to `/students/edit/:studentId` route
- And I should see the form pre-populated with the student's existing data
- And all existing form functionality should work identically to the sidebar version

### Scenario 3: Form Submission and Navigation
- Given I am on either the add or edit student page
- When I successfully submit the form
- Then the student should be saved/updated in the data store
- And I should be redirected to the Student Management page
- And I should see a success toast notification
- And the student should appear in the table with updated information

### Scenario 4: Cancel/Back Navigation
- Given I am on the student form page
- When I click "Cancel" or use browser back button
- Then I should return to the Student Management page
- And no changes should be saved
- And I should not see any error messages

### Scenario 5: Form Layout and Responsiveness
- Given I am on the student form page
- When I view the form on different screen sizes
- Then the form should be responsive and well-organized
- And all form sections should be easily accessible without excessive scrolling
- And the form should utilize the full page width effectively

### Scenario 6: URL and Route Handling
- Given I have a direct URL to a student edit page
- When I navigate to `/students/edit/:studentId` directly
- Then the page should load correctly with the student's data
- And if the student ID doesn't exist, I should see an appropriate error state

## Development Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Page Infrastructure
1. **Create Student Form Pages**
   - Create `/src/pages/StudentFormPage.tsx` - Main form page component
   - Handle both add and edit modes based on route parameters
   - Implement proper page layout with breadcrumbs and navigation
   - Add responsive design for full-page form experience

2. **Update Routing Configuration**
   - Add new routes in `/src/App.tsx`:
     - `/students/new` - Add new student
     - `/students/edit/:studentId` - Edit existing student
   - Ensure proper route parameter handling
   - Maintain existing `/students/:studentId` profile route

3. **Create Page Layout Components**
   - Create breadcrumb navigation component
   - Implement consistent page header with form title
   - Add navigation helpers (back button, cancel functionality)
   - Ensure consistent styling with app theme

### Phase 2: Form and State Management Updates
4. **Refactor Student Form Component**
   - Update `StudentForm.tsx` to work optimally in full-page context
   - Improve section layout for wider screens
   - Consider horizontal layouts for some form fields
   - Maintain all existing form validation and functionality

5. **Update Form Hooks**
   - Modify `useStudentForm.ts` to work with page-based navigation
