# Batch Assigning Payment Obligations Guide

## Overview

The "Batch Assign" feature allows administrators to efficiently assign payment obligations to multiple students simultaneously. This is particularly useful for recurring obligations like tuition fees, activity fees, or other charges that apply to groups of students.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Access the Batch Assign Function
1. Navigate to the Financial Management module
2. Select the "Payment Obligations" tab
3. Click on the "Batch Assign" tab

### Step 2: Select Students
1. Use the dropdown to select multiple students
2. You can search for specific students by typing their name
3. Selected students will appear as badges in the selection area
4. Review your selection to ensure all intended students are included

### Step 3: Define Obligation Details
1. Fill in the obligation details:
   - Obligation Type (tuition, registration, etc.)
   - Amount ($)
   - Due Date
   - Period (academic year/semester)
   - Notes (optional)
2. Click "Apply to Selected Students" to proceed

### Step 4: Review and Confirm
1. A summary screen will display:
   - Number of students selected
   - Obligation type and amount
   - Due date and period
   - Notes (if provided)
2. Review the information carefully
3. Click "Confirm Creation" to create obligations for all selected students

### Step 5: Completion
1. Once completed, you will see a success notification
2. The system will automatically return to the obligations view
3. You can filter the table to see the newly created obligations

## Best Practices

- **Group Similar Obligations**: Use batch assignments for obligations that are identical for multiple students
- **Verify Before Confirming**: Always carefully review the summary before final confirmation
- **Use Descriptive Notes**: Add notes to help identify batches of obligations
- **Check Results**: After creation, verify that all obligations were created correctly

## Troubleshooting

- If some obligations fail to create, the system will show an error message
- Ensure all required fields are completed before proceeding to the confirmation step
- If you need to cancel the process, use the "Back" or "Cancel" buttons at any stage
