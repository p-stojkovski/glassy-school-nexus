Coding Problem Solution Template
Problem Description
[Clearly state the problem here, including constraints such as input size, expected runtime, or memory limits. Highlight any requirements that impact complexity or performance, ensuring the problem is well-defined for an optimized solution.]
Approach
[Outline your chosen strategy or algorithm, focusing on:

Low Complexity: Why this approach minimizes time (e.g., O(n) vs. O(n²)) and space usage.
Single Responsibility: How you’ll break the solution into small, focused functions or modules, each handling one task.
Performance: Why this method avoids unnecessary computations or memory overhead.
Assumptions made to simplify the problem without sacrificing correctness.
High-level steps, written clearly to prioritize simplicity and efficiency.]

Solution Code
// Write modular, efficient code here.
// Each function/module has one clear responsibility (e.g., parsing input, computing results).
// Use concise comments for clarity, avoiding over-commenting obvious logic.
// Optimize for performance with minimal loops, efficient data structures, etc.

Explanation
[Break down how the code implements the approach, step-by-step:

Highlight how each part maintains low complexity (e.g., avoiding nested loops where possible).
Show how single responsibility is enforced (e.g., one function computes, another validates).
Detail performance optimizations (e.g., reusing variables, choosing arrays over hash tables when order matters).This ensures the solution is easy to follow, debug, and maintain.]

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: [State the time complexity (e.g., O(n)). Justify it with specifics (e.g., single pass over data) and explain how it achieves low complexity.]
Space Complexity: [State the space complexity (e.g., O(1)). Justify it (e.g., using only a few variables) and confirm it aligns with low complexity goals.]

Performance Considerations
[Detail optimizations and trade-offs made for performance:

How you reduced redundant calculations (e.g., memoization, pre-computation).
Why specific data structures or algorithms were chosen for efficiency (e.g., array vs. linked list).
Any potential bottlenecks (e.g., large inputs) and how they’re mitigated (e.g., early exits, batch processing).Keep the focus on balancing performance with simplicity and maintainability.]

Reflection
[Reflect on the solution process, emphasizing:

Lessons on achieving low complexity (e.g., simplifying logic without losing accuracy).
Insights into enforcing single responsibility (e.g., splitting tasks improved clarity).
Balancing performance with readable, maintainable code (e.g., avoiding over-optimization).
Challenges faced (e.g., optimizing for edge cases) and solutions applied.
Potential further improvements (e.g., alternative algorithms) and their trade-offs.
Connections to broader concepts (e.g., how this reinforces efficient design principles).]
