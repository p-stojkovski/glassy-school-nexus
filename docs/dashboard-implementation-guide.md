### Component Structure

```tsx
Dashboard
â”œâ”€â”€ StandardDemoNotice (Top priority)
â”œâ”€â”€ Header with Search
â”œâ”€â”€ Key Metrics Grid (4 cards)
â”œâ”€â”€ Attendance & Financial Row (2 widgets)
â”œâ”€â”€ Private Lessons & Quick Actions Row (2 widgets)
â””â”€â”€ System Health & Recent Activities Row (3 columns)
```

## ðŸ“¡ Data Integration

### Redux Integration

**Selectors Used**:
- `state.students.students` - Student data
- `state.teachers.teachers` - Teacher data
- `state.classes.classes` - Class schedules

- `state.attendance.attendanceRecords` - Attendance data
- `state.finance.payments` - Payment records
- `state.finance.obligations` - Financial obligations
- `state.privateLessons.lessons` - Private lesson data

### Real-time Updates

**Auto-refresh Strategy**:
- Uses `useMemo` for expensive calculations

- ISO date format consistency
- Week calculation with Monday start
- Timezone-aware comparisons

**Aggregations**:
- Attendance percentage calculations
- Financial status summaries
- Class scheduling logic
- Payment status tracking
