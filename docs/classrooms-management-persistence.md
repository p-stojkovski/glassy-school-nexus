# Classroom Management Data Persistence

The Classroom Management feature stores all classroom information in your browser's local storage.

## How It Works

- Data is saved under the `localStorage.classrooms` key
- Any changes you make are immediately persisted and remain after refreshing
- First-time users will see sample data if none is stored

## Demo Mode Limitations

- Data never leaves your browser
- Clearing browser storage or using another device will reset the data

## Technical Implementation

1. **Redux Toolkit Slice** - Manages classrooms state
2. **localStorage API** - Persists data across sessions
3. **Error Handling** - Graceful failures when storage is unavailable
