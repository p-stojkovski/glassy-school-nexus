## MockDataService Analysis

### Architecture
- **Pattern**: Singleton service with unified data management
- **Storage Strategy**: localStorage with JSON serialization
- **Caching**: In-memory cache with lazy loading
- **Data Validation**: Structure validation before save/load operations
- **Fallback Strategy**: JSON files → localStorage → cache hierarchy

### Key Features
1. **Domain-Specific Loading**: Each domain can load independently
2. **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing data operations
3. **Export/Import**: Full data backup/restore capabilities
4. **Demo Reset**: Reset to default JSON data
5. **Storage Health**: Availability checks and error handling
6. **Data Statistics**: Usage metrics and storage monitoring

### Current Data Persistence Patterns
1. **Unified (MockDataService)**: students, teachers, classes, classrooms, attendance
2. **Direct localStorage**: grades, private lessons (legacy)
3. **Hybrid**: classrooms (both MockDataService + direct localStorage)
4. **In-memory**: auth (demo only)

## Data Model Analysis

### Core Entities

#### Student Entity
```typescript
interface Student {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  avatar?: string;
  classId: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive';
  joinDate: string;
  parentContact: string;
  parentEmail: string;
  placeOfBirth: string;
  dateOfBirth: string;
  address: string;
  paymentDue: boolean;
  lastPayment: string;
  emergencyContact: {
    name: string;
    relationship: string;
    phone: string;
  };
  academicInfo: {
    level: string;
    gpa: number;
    enrollmentDate: string;
  };
  hasDiscount: boolean;
  discountType: DiscountType;
  discountAmount: number;
}
```

#### Class Entity
```typescript
interface Class {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  teacher: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    subject: string;
    avatar: string;
  };
  room: string;
  roomId: string;
  schedule: Array<{
    day: string;
    startTime: string;
    endTime: string;
  }>;
  status: string;
  students: number;
  maxStudents: number;
  studentIds: string[];

  lastUpdated: string;
}
```

  type: string;
  amount: number;
  dueDate: string;
  period: string;
  status: ObligationStatus;
  notes?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### Key Relationships

2. **Class → Teacher**: Many-to-one (class has one primary teacher)
3. **Class → Classroom**: Many-to-one (class uses one room)
4. **Student → PaymentObligation**: One-to-many
5. **PaymentObligation → Payment**: One-to-many
6. **Student → AttendanceRecord**: One-to-many
7. **Assessment → Grade**: One-to-many (per student)
8. **PrivateLesson → Student**: Many-to-one
9. **PrivateLesson → Teacher**: Many-to-one

## Integration Challenges

### Data Consistency
- Multiple persistence patterns need unification
- Cross-domain relationships require careful handling
- Demo reset functionality must be maintained

### State Management
- Redux actions expect specific data shapes
- Error handling patterns vary across domains
- Loading states need consistent API integration

### Real-time Requirements
- Some features may need real-time updates (attendance, scheduling)
- Optimistic updates with rollback capabilities
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

### Legacy Patterns
- Direct localStorage usage in grades and private lessons
- Inconsistent error handling approaches
- Mixed synchronous/asynchronous patterns

## Recommendations

### Backend Architecture
1. **Follow Vertical Slice Architecture** per API rules.md
2. **Implement Domain-Driven Design** for complex business logic
3. **Use Result<T> Pattern** for consistent error handling
4. **Apply Strong Typing** with value objects
5. **Leverage Dapper + PostgreSQL** for data access

### API Design
1. **RESTful endpoints** aligned with frontend domain structure
2. **Consistent error responses** using Problem Details RFC
3. **Pagination support** for large datasets
4. **Bulk operation endpoints** for efficiency
5. **Real-time capabilities** where needed (SignalR)

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Core entities (students, classes, teachers)
2. **Phase 2**: Financial system integration
3. **Phase 3**: Attendance and grades
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features (private lessons, real-time)
5. **Phase 5**: Optimization and performance

## Next Steps

1. **Database Schema Design** - Create normalized PostgreSQL schema
2. **API Endpoint Specification** - Define REST API contract
3. **Integration Roadmap** - Phase-by-phase implementation plan
4. **Data Migration Strategy** - localStorage → PostgreSQL migration
5. **Testing Strategy** - Ensure frontend compatibility
