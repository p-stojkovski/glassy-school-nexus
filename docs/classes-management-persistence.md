# Classes Management Data Persistence

The Classes Management feature provides a realistic administration experience by persisting data in the browser's local storage.

## How It Works

- All class data is stored in your browser's local storage
- When you add, edit, or delete classes, changes are immediately saved and will persist even if you refresh the browser
- The first time you use the application, sample class data is automatically generated

## Demo Mode Limitations

- This is a frontend-only demo, so data is only stored locally in your browser
- Data will persist between browser sessions on the same device
- If you clear your browser data or use a different browser/device, you'll start with fresh demo data
- No data is sent to any server

## Technical Implementation

The data persistence is implemented using:

1. **Redux State Management** - Manages the in-memory state
2. **localStorage API** - Provides persistent storage across browser sessions
3. **Error Handling** - Gracefully handles cases where localStorage might not be available
